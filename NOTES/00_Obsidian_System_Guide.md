# 🎛️ My Obsidian Guide
## 1. The Tagging Topology (Your Filter Bank)

We do not use random tags. We use a **Hierarchical Taxonomy** that forces the Graph View to cluster nodes into logical "Frequency Bands."

### 🔴 The "Type" Tags (Shape of the Node)

_These define what the note IS._

- `#type/principle` 🧠 : A fundamental truth (Physics, Math, Biology). _Ex: Conservation of Energy._
    
- `#type/math` 📐 : A specific formula or theorem. _Ex: Euler's Identity._
    
- `#type/algo` ⚙️ : A specific algorithm or logic flow. _Ex: Fast Fourier Transform._
    
- `#type/code` 💻 : A snippet of C++ implementation. _Ex: `class MDCT {...}`_
    
- `#type/artifact` 💿 : A result or audible phenomenon. _Ex: Pre-Echo, Quantization Noise._
    

### 🔵 The "Domain" Tags (Color of the Node)

_These define where the note LIVES._

- `#domain/time` ⏳ : Time-Domain concepts (Samples, Buffers).
    
- `#domain/freq` 🌊 : Frequency-Domain concepts (Spectrum, Phase).
    
- `#domain/bio` 👂 : Psychoacoustics and human hearing.
    
- `#domain/info` ℹ️ : Information Theory and Bits.
    

### 🟢 The "Status" Tags (The Processing Stage)

- `#status/input` 📥 : Just reading/learning.
    
- `#status/processing` 🔨 : Currently coding/experimenting.
    
- `#status/clipping` ⚠️ : Stuck / Confusion / The math isn't working.
    
- `#status/mastered` ✅ : "Null Test Passed." I understand this fully.

## 2. The Linkage Strategy (The Circuitry)

Do not link words just because they exist in other notes. Link **Logic Flows**.

### A. The Vertical Link (Drill-Down)

Every Project Note must link "Up" to the Roadmap and "Down" to the Components.

- _Structure:_ `Phase 1 Roadmap` $\to$ `Bit Crusher Project` $\to$ `Quantization Math`.
    

### B. The Horizontal Link (Translation)

Link the **Math** directly to the **Code**. This is crucial for the Graph.

- _Example:_ Inside `01_Basic_Linear_Quantization.md`, you must link:
    
    > "This code implements the logic defined in [[Non_Linear_Quantization_Power_Law]]."
    

### C. The Cliffhanger Link (The Daisy Chain)

This is the most unique part of your system.

Every note MUST end with a logical flaw that links to the Next Note. This creates a single, unbroken chain through the entire vault (like a Linked List).

> The Cliffhanger Format:
> 
> "We solved X, but now Y is broken. This leads us to [[Next_Topic_Name]]."

## 3. The Graph View Configuration 🕸️

To see the "Circuit Diagram" clearly, configure your Obsidian Graph settings as follows:

1. **Groups (Colors):**
    
    - **Red:** `tag:#domain/time` (Time Domain)
        
    - **Blue:** `tag:#domain/freq` (Frequency Domain)
        
    - **Green:** `tag:#domain/bio` (Biology/Psychoacoustics)
        
    - **Yellow:** `tag:#type/code` (The actual C++ implementations)
        
2. **Forces:**
    
    - Increase **Repel Force** (spread the nodes out).
        
    - Turn on **Arrows** (to visualize the Cliffhanger flow).
        

What a "Healthy" Graph looks like:

You should see clusters of Red (Time) and Blue (Frequency) connected by Yellow (Code) bridges. If you see a lone node with no connections, it means you have "Dead Code" or "Useless Theory."

## 4. The "Null Test" Template 📝

When creating a new note, use this structure to ensure depth.

Markdown

````
# Topic: [Insert Topic Name]
#type/principle #domain/dsp #status/input

## 1. The First Principle 🧠
*What is the fundamental physics/math truth here?*
*(Link to: [[Previous_Cliffhanger_Note]])*

## 2. The Mathematical Model 📐
*The Equation:* $$y = f(x)$$
*Why this equation?*

## 3. The C++ Implementation 💻
```cpp
// Your optimized code here
````

## 4. The Artifact (What does it sound like?) 💿

_Describe the sound:_ (e.g., "Metallic ringing," "White hiss").

## 5. The Cliffhanger (The Logic Gap) 🔗

The current model fails because...

Therefore, we must investigate: [[Next_Topic_Name]]

```

## 5. Learning Curve Strategy

1.  **Don't over-tag:** Start with just **Type** and **Status**. Add Domains later.
2.  **Follow the Chain:** Do not create a new note until you have defined the "Cliffhanger" in the previous note. This forces you to understand *why* you are learning the next topic.
3.  **The "Null Test" Rule:** You cannot mark a note as `#status/mastered` until you can explain it to a 5-year-old OR your C++ code compiles and runs.
