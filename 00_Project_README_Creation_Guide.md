## 1. The Executive Summary
* **The "One-Liner":** (Explain this concept as if talking to a 5-year-old. No jargon.)
* **The Engineering Goal:** (What are we building? e.g., *To create a mathematical function that reduces bit depth.*)
* **The "Why":** (Why does this matter? What happens if we skip this?)

> [!ABSTRACT] Conceptual Hook
> Use this space for the core analogy.
> *Example: "Quantization is like measuring the ocean with a ruler that only has marks every 10 meters."*

## 2. The Physics (First Principles)
**The Reality vs. The Digital:**
* **Continuous Reality:** Describe the physical phenomenon (e.g., Voltage, Pressure, Time).
* **The Constraint:** Describe the limitation of the machine (e.g., Finite switches, Sample Rate).

**The Breakdown:**
* Use bullet points to map the transition from Analog to Digital.
* *Do not write code here.* This is for conceptual models only.

> [!NOTE] The Intuition
> If there is a "Key Insight" or "Aha! Moment" that unlocks this topic, put it here.

## 3. The Math (The Engine)
We must derive the formula before we code it.

**Variables:**
* $x$: Input Signal
* $L$: Resolution / Scale Factor
* $y$: Output Signal

**The Derivation:**
1.  **Step 1:** Define the scaling factor.
    $$L = 2^{bits} - 1$$
2.  **Step 2:** The Transformation.
    (Explain the core equation step-by-step using LaTeX block equations).
    $$
    y = \frac{\text{round}(x \cdot L)}{L}
    $$

**Why this works:**
* Explain the significance of the operations (e.g., "Rounding destroys the information").

## 4. The Implementation (C++ / DSP)
Translating math into instructions.

```cpp
// [[Link to actual source file in your codebase]]
// Implementation of: Topic Name

float process(float input, int param) {
    // 1. Comment your steps clearly
    float x = input;
    
    // 2. The Logic
    // ... code here ...

    return x;
}

> [!WARNING] Common Pitfalls
> 
> - Integer overflow?
>     
> - Divide by zero errors?
>     
> - Issues with silence (The "Zero" problem)?
>

## 5. The Experiment (Verification)

**The Setup:**

1. **Input Signal:** (e.g., 100Hz Sine Wave at -6dB)
    
2. **Parameters:** (e.g., Bit Depth = 3)
    
3. **Visualizer Expectation:** (What should the waveform look like?)
    

**The Observations:**

- **Visual:** (e.g., "The sine wave turned into stairsteps.")
    
- **Aural:** (e.g., "I heard a fuzzy distortion riding the signal.")

## 6. The Synthesis & Cliffhanger

**The Flaw:** Every solution introduces a new problem. What is broken about this current implementation?

- _Example: "It handles loud sounds fine, but silence causes a limit cycle oscillation."_
    

**The Bridge:** How does this lead to the next note?

- _"To fix the oscillation, we need to introduce randomness..."_ -> leads to [[02_Dither_and_Chaos]].

### How to use this Guide (The "Meta" Instructions)

1.  **The Header:** This is your anchor. The `#status/active` tag allows you to use Dataview later to see what you are currently learning.
2.  **The Callouts (`> [!NAME]`):** These are vital for skimming. When you review your notes in 6 months, you will likely only read the Callouts. Make them count.
3.  **The Math:** Always use `$$` blocks for the main formula. It forces you to stop and ensure the math is beautiful and correct.
4.  **The Cliffhanger:** This is unique to your "First Principles" learning style. You aren't just memorizing facts; you are following a narrative. Always end a note by identifying the **Failure Mode** of the current topic. This justifies the existence of the next note.

**Next Step:** Create your folder `01_Phase_1_Master_Bit_Crusher` and inside it, create `01_Linear_Quantization.md` using this template. Fill it out based on our session today.
