Another song like "We Die Young" is this one. It struggles to be part of the mood of Facelift instrumentally. It doesn't feel like it belongs here. Maybe I'm wrong.
<br/><br/>
In fact, the vocal setup reminds me of the self-titled album in some ways - like when Layne sings the "In my life..the dyin' nothin'" part. Now while I still like the self-titled vocal style, this is not something that should be part of an album when you have songs like some of the "LAYNE was something" ones. This infact, is a major step down from the amazing "Love, Hate, Love" according to me.
<br/><br/>
Overall, it's okay. It's just - it feels like they tried to make a radio hit.
<br/><br/>
However, to be honest this is just a nice heavy song that they put out and you can't go wrong with it.
