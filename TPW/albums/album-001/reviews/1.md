I don't know honestly. I've never really enjoyed this song and I skip it whenever I listen to Facelift. I don't really find anything apealing about it.
<br/><br/>
I feel like with this song, they tried to show their instrumental excellence over their ability to use thought provoking lyrics to create amazing soundscapes. I sometimes feel like there should have been an EP between Facelift and Dirt with songs like this. That would have been able to express the transition from Facelift to Dirt much better (this song is gives me "Would?" vibes which is I can best prove by comparing the ending of this song to "Would?"'s ending).
<br/><br/>
I frankly don't have much to talk about here in terms of lyrics.
<br/><br/>
Let's skip this and move on to the next one.

Rating: 3.5/5 (doesn't really fit this album)
