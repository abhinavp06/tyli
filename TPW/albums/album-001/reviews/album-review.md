Overall, it's not perfect. The album feels like a mashup of "genius" and "please launch my band" kind of songs. On one hand you have songs which contain so much emotion and then all of a sudden you have the second half which is just so disconnected from the first.
<br/><br/>
Apart from the songs, the tracklist itself isn't supportive enough when you look at the lyrics. You have a man shouting at the top of his lungs "We Die Young" and then the next song immediately goes to a man crying to Jesus. Something similar is seen in terms of intensity. As I highlighted in my "Sea Of Sorrow" review, the difference between that song and "Man In The Box" is big enough to make an impact on me and make me feel like I'm being forced to slow down rather than a natural descent.
<br/><br/>
While the album as a whole may not be well organized, you certainly cannot ignore the amount of musical talent that is present. Can you imagine being the first ever to hear a voice like Layne's back in 1990? I wish I could experience that feeling. Every member does their job very well. Mike is always amazing with his bass and always helps guide the "feeling" of the song by giving it structure. Jerry is obviously very important when it comes to the lyrics and the lead. There are sparkles of subtle elegance. Sean ofcourse, fill the remaining space with his drums. The reverb on the drums help, but you can definitely feel the amount of thrust he applies on each snare hit.
<br/><br/>
In my opinion, this is what the album should have been =>
<br/><br/>
Facelift
1. Man In The Box
2. I Can't Remember
3. Confusion
4. Sea Of Sorrow
5. Bleed The Freak
6. Love, Hate, Love

The EP that should have been made between Facelift and Dirt:
1. We Die Young
2. It Ain't Like That
3. Sunshine
4. Put You Down
5. I Know Somethin (Bout You)
6. Real Thing
<br/>
If you consider Facelift as a 2 disc album, that EP should have been the side B. Maybe that would have made me appreciate those songs more.
<br/><br/>
Sometimes I feel that I'm too harsh on this album because I always emphasize the vocals more. It is what it is.
<br/><br/>
Overall, a solid debut album. I'd sign them for sure ;)
