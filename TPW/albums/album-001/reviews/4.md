The transition from "Sea of Sorrow" to this song is a big supporting argument from my claim earlier that this album is not a masterpiece. In my opinion, this album should have been divided in 2 parts (actually 3 but more on that later) - the part where you're helpless and the part where you become more confident in yourself. This is also why you will notice after reading my summarised album review that the songs in the "first" half (the tracklist that I have written down in the review) generally seem to be higher rated compared to the second half. The "cries for help" attitude is much better executed in terms of lyrics in the first half compared to the confrontational/confident second half.
<br/><br/>
The song "Bleed the Freak" is one of the best songs in the second half.
<br/><br/>
The intro bass guitar and acoustic give me TOOL vibes. The song has some soothing soundscapes like you may find in TOOL songs. This may seem like a stupid claim but I believe if you have an ear for this subgenre and genuinely enjoy it, you might agree with me.
<br/><br/>
```"My cup runneth over
 Like blood from a stone"```
<br/><br/>
Which is basically "I am so wealthy. Just kidding, I don't have anything. I'm empty. I'm done draining myself for you."
<br/><br/>
```"These stand for me
 Name your god and bleed the freak
 I'd like to see
 How you all would bleed for me"```
<br/><br/>
Layne seems to be done with being the giver all the time. He seems exhausted and now asks the people he bleeds for to bleed for them. He does not want unequal relationships with these people.
<br/><br/>
```"When the pig runs slower (slower)
 Let the arrow fly (fly)
 When the sin lies bolder (bolder)
 I'll pluck out thine eye (I'll pluck out thine eye)"

 "If you scorn my lover (lover)
 Satan got your thigh (thigh)
 If you steal in hunger (hunger)
 I will kick you when you try (when you try)"```
<br/><br/>
Pretty basic lines. The person is taking his revenge. He tells them that he wil serve justice once he catches them.
<br/><br/>
Coming to the 2.30 mark.
<br/><br/>
I think this is the song that made me start to appreciate Jerry. He really understands this subgenre and knows how the guitar tones help so much. While he is not too flashy, I like the subtle hints of "shredding \m/" that he adds sometimes.
<br/><br/>
The second "bleed for me" is obviously another testament to why you cannot ignore Layne Staley as a vocalist. This is also one of those "Layne was SOMETHING" songs when I heard it for the first time as I mentioned in my "I Can't Remember" review.
<br/><br/>
I like this reverb that they put on the drums. It's a nice touch.
<br/><br/>
Mike as always is solid in this. He literally is the baseline (*ba dum tsss*) for the structures of all these amazing songs.
