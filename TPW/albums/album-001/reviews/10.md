```"There's no time to give at all
 I cause you grief 
 and blow my hatred further in your mind
 You reach, I run, you fall
 On skinned knees you crawl
 I want to set you free!
 Yeaaaah!
 recognize my disease!
 Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering
 You're there crying, I feel not a thing
 Drilling my way deeper in your head
 Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead"```
<br/><br/>
You remember those animations of going into a black hole while the stars around you slowly start to fade away and then their speed just increases so quickly. That's what this first part of the song feels like. It's so intense. The slow pace in the beginning really help us appreciate Layne's vocals even more.
<br/><br/>
Perhaps this is a genius move by the band to make you feel how an abusive relationship is. It starts off real slow but then it picks pace and you just keep falling into it while the world around you starts to fade away. I wonder what causes this? As I wait for Consensus to answer this prompt -"Cite some sources and summaries in 1000 words why people in abusive relationships feel difficult to let go of the relationship?" , let's enjoy the music. Mike Starr was a gem. His contribution to Facelift is what lifts this album from a 3.9ish to the leagues of 4.5-4.8 (depending on my mood). Phenomenal bass playing. The sound is so controlled and sharp but with just enough height to make it feel alive (it's like those pill shaped magnets that you get but like the diameter is much lesser - this is how I perceive the bass). I find Sean hits the snare so hard in this song. It's like he's beating the snare. I don't know if this was intentional or not but it's pretty cool. Jerry is so subtle. It kinda suits his vibe. Very calm and collected and picking up the energy when required (i.e, the chorus).
<br/><br/>
Okay so, these are some of the top papers I got.
<br/><br/>
1. "LEAVING AN ABUSIVE PARTNER - An Empirical Review of Predictors, the Process of Leaving, and Psychological Well-Being" by DEBORAH K. ANDERSON & DANIEL G. SAUNDERS (University Of Michigan)
    Economic dependence seems to be a factor. This makes sense. C.R.E.A.M. The psychological aspect is mentioned as well. You form a strong bond with someone and it's difficult. Meh, this is boring. I don't feel like researching about anything today.
<br/><br/>
Let's hop back into the song.
<br/><br/>
It seems that the abuser is self aware of the pain they are inflicting on their partner. However, I sometimes think what if this act of "self-awareness" is also a manipulation tactic? Like, they play this card to soften the impact of their abuse. It's purely mental torture according to me. Must be horrible being stuck in an abusive relationship.
<br/><br/>
The line "You're there crying, I feel not a thing". I overthink about this, "paradox" I suppose, a lot. How is one self aware that they don't feel a thing yet they can feel not feeling a thing. I believe that for those of you who have ever thought this way can recall "feeling nothing" still feels like feeling something. It's so weird!
<br/><br/>
The backing vocals (both when they're loud and when they're whispered) are so nice during the chorus. I'm still trying to think of how Jerry's vocals in this song can be represented as a separate entity. Overanalysing is so cool!
<br/><br/>
```"So you sit and think of love
 I wait, hate all the more, I fall
 On skinned knees I crawl
 I want to set you free!"```
<br/><br/>
Again, the first line is nothing but a fantasy of the victim. They think they're still in love. The abuser is waiting for the victim to understand that "love" does not exist among them anymore.
<br/><br/>
Now, an important detail that you may miss while listening to this casually is how the first chorus stated "You crawl" yet this in this chorus it is sung as "I crawl". The abuser seems to be a victim now too? It's like they're saying that "I can't bear this anymore. I too don't want to drag this relationship anymore. I'm literally crawling while my knees are scraped, dragging myself out of this hole". This is so interesting! So, now the abuser wants to leave yet the victim does not want them to as the victim still thinks they are in love? Is the victim suddenly an abuser now or is it just an abuser trying to justify their abuse? Now, I feel like reading those research papers. 
<br/><br/>
```"Now there's time to give it all
 I put my fears behind again
 On skinned knees we'll crawl
 I want to set you free!"```
<br/><br/>
They seem to be arriving at an understanding. Let's work this out. Let us both get out of this mess. But I feel like this can just invoke the feeling of togetherness in them which will again start the abusive cycle (as I write this the song just restarted again as I listen to the song on loop while writing - perhaps this is a sign I'm correct haha).
<br/><br/>
Another thing that I quite like is how the pace is used in this song. It suddenly picks you up and then there's a calming feeling after the chorus. The snare really sells this "drop" to me. The guitar has this effect of stars blinking which makes it all feel like a dream. The bass, as always, feels like your heartbeat - going up and down. Genius honestly.
<br/><br/>
I believe this is the best song musically on this album simply because of how they use the pace to really make you feel how it is to be in an abusive relationship.
<br/><br/>
Also, that sound effect when Layne sings "sinking" tickles my ear everytime. Thank you to whoever did that.
