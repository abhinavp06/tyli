So, in H.P. Lovecraft's "Beyond the Wall of Sleep" - the story this song is based on, it states:
<br/><br/>
"Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences—Freud to the contrary with his puerile symbolism—there are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation, and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life, yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier."
<br/><br/>
When was the last time you actually dreamed? Not about something real. I mean the unreal. It's so liberating. You exist, but you don't really exist.
<br/><br/>
"Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon."
<br/><br/>
I assume when people talk about eternal bliss, this is what they mean. It is the same liberating feeling we witness rarely. You feel light-headed physically. In fact, there is a sense of calmness in your mind. You can feel it.
<br/><br/>
The author talks about a man Joe Slater, or "Slaader" who seems to belong to a mountainous region's isolated tribe. The author states that the man is quite backward in his ideologies. He apparently does not have any identification records but is assumed to be around forty by the head surgeon of the institution that the author is taking him in. The man describes him as this well-built tall man who doesn't mean any harm due to the look perceived by his sleepy eyes, his shabby beard and the drooping of his heavy nether lip.
<br/><br/>
This man habitually slept very late in the night. He would talk about unknown things in a scary way. He himself would be just as terrified and would always forget what he said and why he said it within an hour of waking up. 
<br/><br/>
"As Slater grew older, it appeared, his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence; till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities."
<br/><br/>
One day, after a deep sleep induced by a "whiskey debauch," Slater woke with "ululations so horrible and unearthly" which drew neighbors to his filthy cabin. Rushing into the snow, he began leaping high into the air, screaming his determination to reach a "big, big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor, and the loud queer music far away". When two men tried to restrain him, he shouted about wanting to kill "a thing that shines and shakes and laughs". He violently attacked the two men and fled into the woods only to be found unconscious days later and taken to jail.
<br/><br/>
During the interrogation, he just says that he woke up covered in blood next to his neighbour. He seems to be hellbent on his desire to kill the entity.
<br/><br/>
Now, the narrator himself always speculates about a "dream life". So, naturally he becomes fascinated by Slater. He finds it perplexing how Slater can imagine these visions even though he is illiterate and probably does not know anything about myths or legends. He thought that Slater is experiencing that same liberating feeling I talked about earlier which he cannot comprehend. The narrator deduces that if such a true dream-world existed, oral language was not its medium for thought transmission, and perhaps he was witnessing the struggle of a dream-soul to communicate through an inadequate body.
<br/><br/>
The narrator  wants to dive deeper into this so he repairs his telepathy instruments which he believed worked since he thought that human thinking is nothing but an atomic motion convertible into either waves of radiant energy. He starts performing experiments in secret on Slater.
<br/><br/>
On February 21, 1901, as Slater was dying, in the presence of a sleeping nurse, the narrator places his "cosmic raido" headbands on Slater and himself. He soon ends up faling asleep only to be awakened by a "weird lyric melody" and "ultimate beauty". He finds himself floating in a world full of walls made of "living fire". He also experienced visions of valleys and mountains. All these elements seem to be part of an entity which seems as much spirit as matter. He realises that his own brain holds the key to these "enchanting metamorphoses".
<br/><br/>
In this realm, he meets an aura with which he communicates soul to soul with silent and perfect interchange of thought. So apparently, this aura is escaping from a bondage and is after the opressor.
<br/><br/>
Suddenly, the narrator wakes up. He notices Slater's eyes seem to show an "active mind of high order". The narrator's brain receives an external influence - his "long-sought mental message". This message translates to "Joe Slater is dead".
<br/><br/>
The entity which is speaking through Slater's dying body explains that Slater's "gross body" had been its torment for 42 human years and was unfit to understand the entity's intellect. The entity seems to be a traveller across many time-spaces. He seems to have wandered into this realm. He talks about his previous travels which further confirm his ability to travel through space and time.
<br/><br/>
The entity identifies its "accursed oppressor" as Algol, the Daemon-Star, and declares its immediate departure to "meet and conquer the oppressor," stating, "Tonight I go as a Nemesis bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeance. Watch me in the sky close by the Daemon-Star".
<br/><br/>
Just like that, the entity ceases communication and Slater dies.
<br/><br/>
The narrator's superior, Dr. Fenton, disimisses his account as his imagination. The narrator argues and states that he cannot forget what he saw in the sky the night after Slater died. He quotes a professor who was quite an eminent astronomical authority. The professor's account describes the discovery of a new star which was later identified as "Nova Persei" by another doctor on February 22, 1901. This date is critical as it is the day after Joe Slater's death. The professor's report also states that it was not very far from Algol - the "oppressor" that the entity described earlier. 
<br/><br/>
The narrator then implies that his dream-world and the physical universe are connected as the event he experienced in his dream world resulted in a cosmic event in this physical universe. The narrator leaves it upto us to think about it.
<br/><br/>
It makes me think more about the whole "connected consciousness" thing. Is it possible that we are connected to entities we can't even comprehend in this realm?
<br/><br/>
The lyrics contribute to the overall goal of this song - which is to help you explore a different realms. This is why there are so many different rhythms that the band follows in this song. Ozzy's sound piercing you from both the left and right side has such a nice effect. It really fills out the soundscape.
<br/><br/>
The drums in the end echo which produce this feeling of vastness. You can picture it like flying through space. You are an entity now.
