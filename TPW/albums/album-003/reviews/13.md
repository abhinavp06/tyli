I've just thought of something really cool that I want to try.
<br/><br/>
Linguistics and cryptography is a new interest of mine. I have really wanted to explore the creation of languages & ciphers. Their history as well.
<br/><br/>
Is it possible for us to define a language for "consciousness" as well? Look I know it looks like I'm a _somescientistinamoviebeingportrayedasamadman_ but let's try it. It's so intriguing.
<br/><br/>
So far, we know that consciousness has an intrinsic property of conflict. We also know about the existence of the self. Can we standardise these terms? I'm going to take some time to think about this.
<br/><br/>
I'm going to introduce a new section dedicated to this language - [TYLI](https://tpw.co.in/tyli.html)
