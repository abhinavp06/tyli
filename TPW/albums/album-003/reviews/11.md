When we talk about relationships of any form, there is always an aspect of friction in it. From the friends you have to your romantic partner. This song right here can be interpreted in a lot of ways but for now we'll go with the most basic interpretation - an abusive relationship.
<br/><br/>
What makes someone want to stay in a relationship full of conflicts? We are starting to see that the intrinsic nature of any relationship guided by consciousness is conflict. It seems to be the reason for the existence of anything.
<br/><br/>
```"I saw the gap again today
 While you were begging me to stay
 Take care not to make me enter
 If I do, we both may disappear"```
<br/>
Wow, what an amazing way to set the tone for the song. If you go through the lyrics of the song, you will realise the amount of friction that conflict can create.
<br/><br/>
Why is it that psychological security, which itself is a form of conflict, thrives by components made up of conflict? Is it not cool? The idea that we search for security in someone or something due to conflicts within ourselves but those people or things themselves are full of conflicts is very interesting. Are we not all the same in a way?
<br/><br/>
I talked about the importance of listening equipment in the 9th chapter.
<br/><br/>
In the intro when the strings are played, you can hear the separation between the "static" sounds of the recording and the strings. Soundstage and separation are two important aspects of any musical recording. This is why music production is a very difficult thing to master. I wish audio engineering was a more sought after career.
<br/><br/>
When you listen to Danny's drums, you can "feel" the ups and downs of the mood that Tool is trying to create. Now, this is not something that is groundbreaking. This is what every band does. It is only when you analyse music, you are able to enjoy the musical piece more by noticing these differences. That bassline that Justin has going on in the slower sections... it's like a wave.
<br/><br/>
So, Danny and Justin contribute towards the "bass" (as in the heavier feeling) of a song whereas Maynard & Adam Jones contribute towards the anger, that emotional outburst the song wants to convey. If you have been really reading along, you can sonically feel conflict.
<br/><br/>
This in my opinion is the best song from the album. Of course, "Third Eye" exists, but THIS is the song that ticks all the boxes in an emotional sense. "Third Eye" is an experience, but this is something else too.
<br/><br/>
Here's an exercise to practice your musical analysis skill.
<br/><br/>
From 1.37 onwards till the end of the first chorus, how many layers of sounds can you identify? Can you also visualise the arrangements of different instruments around you?
<ul>
<li>There's a bass that has very small gaps between each note.</li>
<li>A simple repetitive snare and high hat combo. The cymbal coordinates really well with Maynard's vocals. Every "you still love me" lyric is accompanied by that cymbal.</li>
<li>Adam Jones leads with his "fatter" sound.</li>
<li>I also think there are multiple vocal layers that go on top of each other during the "you still love me" part. There's a higher voice but also a lower voice which is accompanying it. If you have a habit of analysing music (like I've had for years), you might also be able to visualise this separation. I'm not really sure if there really are multiple vocal layers here, but I can sense a gap between the highs and lows of the vocals. There's probably also some reverb applied to the higher frequencies.</li>
</ul>
In the chorus, that "But I'd trade it all for just a little peace of mind" lyric at 3.24 is so good. It just drops you down. Then we get a scream by Maynard which is so good!
<br/><br/>
At around 4.16, we enter the second part of this song.
<br/><br/>
Can you hear the reverb in the bass? 
<br/><br/>
At around, 5.04, there is a new guitar tone introduced which are like those wind chimes. There's also another lead going on with it's own set of notes.
<br/><br/>
Analysing music is a hobby I wish more people took part in. I'm going to stop here before I'm perceived as a madman. 
<br/><br/>
Enjoy this 10 minute masterpiece.
