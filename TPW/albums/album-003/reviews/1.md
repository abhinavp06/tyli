You know how there are cult classics in cinema? There are cults in the music industry as well. Tool fans seem to belong to a cult of their own. However, who wouldn't want to possibly NOT join this cult? The lineup that we have come to know and love now creates such phenomenal art.
<br/><br/>
This is a 75+ minute album and every second of it is fun. In fact, this is my favourite Tool album. The overall environment that they managed to produce is something I have been trying to find in their other albums but I just can't seem to replicate it. Sure, people may argue that Lateralus is better than this album and some people say FI or 10K Days. Some seem to find their home in Undertow and some advocate for the Opiate EP (btw, my favourite Tool song is still Cold & Ugly - I love that solo) but come on. This album feels so "grand". I don't know how else I can describe it.
<br/><br/>
In my opinion, artistically, this is their magnum opus. I could review this album multiple times and I would still not run out of content. Remember how I said I would like to be burried with Sabbath's debut album? This is the other album I would choose. 2 profound albums that always help me think more.
<br/><br/>
Sometimes I feel that all this intellectualism is nothing but an excuse to stroke my ego. Even if I were to find a "higher meaning", what is the point? If the so called bliss is better than this current existence, why does it matter? What if I am satisfied with the life I currently have? For example, this blog right here is also not a pathway to find a higher meaning but a medium for me to provide reason for the existence of my curiousness.
<br/><br/>
As much as I want to dive deeper into the meaning of this album, I can't stop my mind from wandering around. The overall theme of this album is evolution. When one thinks of evolution, we think of the physical differences created, intellectual capacity increasing and more.
<br/><br/>
I keep going on and on about this fancy term "consciousness". What is consciousness? What does being aware mean?
<br/><br/>
To tackle all these questions we will first have to establish some rules:
<ol>
<li>We are not experts. We are just questioning.</li>
<li>Personally, I have no interest in achieving "eternal bliss" until I fully understand the reasoning for it's existence. In Hinduism, it is said that once there is a balance of devotion, realisation and cleansing of the self is when one can be one with God. This means that God is the ultimate creator and executor.</li>
<li>As much as I love reading about the philosophy imparted by religions that exist in this world, I want to only use their ideas to help me think. I will not use them as the base for my ideas. The same goes for all the philosophers and spiritual individuals that have ever existed. We will dive deeper into this field objectively, without bias. If I do agree with someone's teachings, I will provide concrete reasonings for it.</li>
</ol>
<br/><br/>
As I read this blog [A Theology of Consciousness by John Lampard](https://theologyeverywhere.org/2020/04/27/a-theology-of-consciousness/),I am introduced to a new term: _panpsychism_. It is the study of consciousness.
<br/><br/>
As I go through this [Kant’s View of the Mind and Consciousness of Self](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/), there is this section that I find really interesting:
<br/>
_Kant accepted without reservation that “God, freedom and immortality” (1781/7, Bxxx) exist but feared that, if science were relevant to their existence at all, it would provide reasons to doubt that they exist. As he saw it and very fortunately, science cannot touch these questions. “I have found it necessary to deny knowledge, … in order to make room for faith.” (Bxxx, his italics)._
<br/>
_Laying the foundation for pursuit of the first aim, which as he saw it was no less than the aim of showing why physics is a science, was what led Kant to his views about how the mind works. He approached the grounding of physics by asking: What are the necessary conditions of experience (A96)? Put simply, he held that for our experience, and therefore our minds, to be as they are, the way that our experience is tied together must reflect the way that, according to physics, says objects in the world must be tied together. Seeing this connection also tells us a lot about what our minds must be like._
<br/><br/>
I think for me to come to such realisations, it is important for me to think in a different way. I will have to remove all biases that I have accumulated throughout my life. I strongly agree with this statement.
<br/><br/>
_Kant discussed the mind only in connection with his main projects, never in its own right, so his treatment is remarkably scattered and sketchy. As he put it, “Enquiry … [into] the pure understanding itself, its possibility and the cognitive faculties upon which it rests … is of great importance for my chief purpose, … [but] does not form an essential part of it”_
<br/><br/>
This does go along with my thought process as well. However, I feel that if I pick resources that almost always align with my thinking, I will never be able to grow.
<br/><br/>
There is a statement right under this which goes into how space and time are 'pure' and not derived from experience. I think we all generally agree (atleast as of now) that space and time are ever present and not created. However, how does one come to this conclusion? Is it even true?
<br/><br/>
One big problem is that the scope of what we are questioning is too large. "What is consciousness?" is so vague. I feel like we need to break this down further.
<br/><br/>
By the way this Standford paper on Kant is an interesting read.
<br/><br/>
Let's say I understand that consciousness exists. Whenever I question the idea of consciousness, it is my consciousness that is looking into itself. How can I observe this entity by separating myself first? Is my consciousness separate from this "ever present" entity?
<br/><br/>
As per my Grok chat an analogy that can help is consciousness as a mirror reflecting itself. Separation requires stepping out but I am the mirror. Okay, we seem to have also encountered the famous phrase - _"The observer is the observed"_.
<br/><br/>
In this review, I will explore my thoughts which I ended up with while watching these videos: 
<ul>
<li>[How can we fully understand 'The observer is the observed'? | J. Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS9r2_fUtWM)</li>
<li>[The observer and the observed are the same | J. Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKC-AQmJx6M)</li>
<li>[Observing without the observer | Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9TqQ8V5zEU)</li>
<li>[How does one negate the 'I' without suppression | J. Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRNmh1zVFgE)</li>
<li>[Observing without words | Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-Dy9cKzF0)</li>
<li>[There is no observer | Krishnamurti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ035oPj7KY)</li>
</ul>

This song man. It's such a nice intro to get yourself to think. It literally drops you into this sea of conflicts. Can you not visualize being dropped into the ocean at night with nothing but waves around you under the moonlit sky? It's not calm. It's chaotic. For some people, the light may provide comfort - stillness in this chaos but the fact is that there just is so much activity. The light can only help so much. If I may, the light only seems to provide some sort of a mental aid to a part of us but the overall situation remains unchanged.
<br/><br/>
The band is so precise. I love Danny's snare here. It's so tight. Gotta love the tabla as well. Adam's guitar tone from 2.57 is so euphoric. Justin always seems to keep everything steady. Bass players should always be appreciated. They are the reason why music has depth. The rumbling sounds should never be ignored. They are the lifeline for groove.
<br/><br/>
MJK uses different vocal styles throughout this song - well, throughout this album. It's such an impactful voice.
