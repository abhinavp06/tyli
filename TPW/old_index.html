            I have just finished writing the last chapter in my 3rd review -
            <a
              href="https://tpw.co.in/album-review.html?album=albums%2Falbum-003"
              target="#blank"
              >Ænima</a
            >. If you're coming here for the first time, please start with my
            3rd review before reading the first 2 reviews (you will understand
            as you start the Ænima review). The text below was written when I
            first created this blog. Some steps/points may not apply anymore
            however I strongly suggest that you go through the text below before
            you start reading my reviews. <br /><br />
            I don't write all the chapters of a review in a single sitting so it
            is possible that I may cover some songs first and some later
            (timestamps might not be in a sequence). I also try my best to match
            the length of my text with the song's length that I'm reviewing. It
            may not line up sometimes so please read in a slower pace :D
            <br /><br />
            I have added some new sections in this website which weren't there
            during the first 2 reviews. You will only understand them after
            reading the
            <a
              href="https://tpw.co.in/album-review.html?album=albums%2Falbum-003"
              target="#blank"
              >Ænima</a
            >
            review. <br /><br />
            In this blog, I want to dive deep into music, consciousness,
            psychology, history, linguistics, software, philosophy and any other
            term you can think of. My goal here is to document all my learnings
            so that I can share my findings with everyone on the internet and
            also revisit them later.
            <br /><br />
            The music "reviews" will cover philosophy and my other interests.
            The 'TYLI' section will contain my research about developing a new
            language altogether.
            <br /><br />
            I'd love feedback and collaboration from anyone who shares similar
            interests.

          <p><strong>---15-07-2025 20:51 TUESDAY---</strong></p>
          <p>
            You know how when you're in your early 20's you start thinking about
            a lot of things? You feel like you're this deeply enlightened person
            and you think that you know a lot. This blog was something that I
            felt would be a way to convey my naive thoughts as well. I had an
            idea for quite some time and finally decided to just execute it.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the way, as I write this introduction, on
            <strong>15th July 2025 at 20:51</strong>, I have already reviewed 2
            songs - <em>"Man In The Box"</em> and <em>"I Can't Remember"</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been collecting music since the age of 10. I am 23 now (will
            turn 24 soon) as I write this. It has been a long journey and my
            collection has kept evolving. After almost 14 years of listening to
            music (I listen to a lot of genres), I found out that I listen to
            Rock & Metal the most. I unfortunately ended up diving too deep into
            these genres and it's quite hard to think of something else becoming
            part of my routine. I still enjoy any genre to ever exist but the
            guitars, drums, screams and the soulful vocals in metal and rock
            seem to be irreplaceable. As I have been collecting music all my
            life, I have lost my hard disks and pendrives which had a lot of
            albums a few times. I am now getting back into building my library
            again but at the same time I am also growing my music taste. It is
            endless and I hope to do this for as long as possible. Also, I have
            just started getting into research as well due to the AI wave.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had at some point also decided to do this with movies. However, at
            this point I think I am better off with music.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Coming to the name.</strong></p>
          <p>
            <em>"The Philosopher's Window"</em> was a fun title I came up with
            while following my usual late night routine of sitting at the
            platform near my bedroom window and just thinking about life while I
            listened to music. Think of these "reviews" being conversations as
            the music plays. I will also try to include research on thoughts I
            come up with. Think of this as a bunch of hobbies grouped into a
            single blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal here is to dive deeper into "the greater meaning of life". I
            have been fascinated by the existence of consciousness, the self and
            God for a long time. I wanted to document my findings somewhere so
            that the readers, yes, you, can help me in my journey as well along
            with me introducing you to some good music. It has been my medium of
            choice for self-expression and exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I want you to understand a few things before you dive into my
            collection of albums:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              What you read is what I'm thinking of at that instant. Analogies
              may not line up sometimes when it comes to tying an album together
              or even within a song. I am literally writing out my thoughts.
              This is not a "musical analysis" blog but more of a "I really
              enjoy listening to music and thinking about things" blog. I am
              quite self aware about how corny this can get, but corny is fun.
              As far as the analogies go, I listen to each song at least 5-10
              times (and a full album can take me at least a week or two
              depending on my day to day schedule) as I write these reviews
              which is why my mind can wander off (which will become quite
              evident as you start reading them). It's a little contradictory
              when you take into the "conversational" aspect I am trying to
              achieve, but you get the point. In a way, these blogs are also
              research papers on their own.
            </li>
            <li>
              I recommend reading my "reviews" by following these steps:
              <ul>
                <li>Read the album pre-review first. Always.</li>
                <li>Read my analysis as you listen to the songs.</li>
                <li>
                  Listen to the album again and try to find what part of the
                  song seems to align with your analogies and what part of the
                  song seems align with mine. Also, make sure to also emphasise
                  listening more to the instruments as well. I tend to focus
                  more on the lyrics when I write these blogs but I absolutely
                  enjoy the instruments just as much. Soundscapes wouldn't exist
                  without instrumentals.
                </li>
                <li>Read my final album review.</li>
                <li>
                  Then listen to the songs in the order I think it should have
                  been in if you feel like it.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              I don't talk a lot about the technicalities of instrumentals
              because I'm not that well versed with musical terms. I understand
              music a lot and emphasise a lot on technicalities while listening
              as well but unfortunately, I cannot convey them in a format that
              is readable (I try my best to put it in words - most of the time
              this can be more of a "it sounds like this/that" or "it
              feels/looks like this/that" kind of a thing).
            </li>
            <li>
              This is just pure fun. I am not a "deep thinker". I just like to
              dive deeper into songs because it makes me appreciate the art of
              sound itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may have landed here because someone told you about it (if I
              ever decide to publish all of this) or I just let you read these.
              Either way, I think a really good way to read my entire album
              collection (if I ever end up covering all the albums that I have -
              around 1219 as of now) is to read my blogs in the ascending order
              of the dates I created them. I will act as a companion and we will
              both grow together as we dive deep into music and life in general.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since it takes a lot of time to sit and review each song, I
              encourage you to focus more on the individuality of a song rather
              than the album reviews. I feel I can communicate better when the
              review context is limited to a single song. However, this is not
              always true. I sometimes may review a song based on how it fits on
              the album as a whole. It just depends on how I approach the song.
              I suppose the similar thing goes for my album ratings too.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to the way I write these reviews, the ratings are not based on
              how good a song is within the artist's discography or how it
              performs against other songs in the genre but on how the song
              makes me feel. Just to remind you again - this is NOT a
              technicality backed approach but a human one.
            </li>
            <li>
              I see this as a long term experiment as well. I want to document
              my mental growth. The idea of my mind having its snapshots taken
              so that I can revisit them later really excites me. The fact that
              the mind in itself can exist in the past and the present at the
              same time is phenomenal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every review is a reflection of the state of mind at that moment
              and I think the beautiful thing about this is that there would
              have been worlds where the same person with the same mind would
              have written something different.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repeating it once again - in my opinion, trying to imagine a
              conversation while you listen to these songs and read the reviews
              will be the best way for you to understand the goal of this blog.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If you have made it this far, congratulations you have a normal
            attention span and will likely enjoy my creation.
