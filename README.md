I love audio. I love math. I love physics. I love software.

# Workflow
Usually, I read some material regarding Audio DSP, go back and forth with Gemini. Then once I understand all the concepts, I think of a project idea based on what I just learnt and try to build something.

The comments you see in the code are usually written by me when I revisit what I wrote later on.

The .md files for each project are generated by Gemini itself by summarizing the conversation and breaking it down into first principle thinking. I don't really bother to check them. Even the Obsidian links are generated by Gemini itself after I give some of my own Obsidian notes to it.

The note .md files are me writing my thoughts down and copying/summarizing some of Gemini's responses. These notes will contain answers to all my questions. I also have an MCQ .md file generated by Gemini to ensure that I have understood everything before I can fully move on to the next section.
