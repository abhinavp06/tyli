# What is this
I love audio. I love math. I love physics. I love software.

I also like to study philosphy and theology and log my thoughts and findings.

This repository is my personal though vault.

# Directory Structure
1. Audio DSP - This contains all my notes and program implementations regarding Audio DSP.
2. TPW - This contains all the text that appears on my website ([The Philosopher's Window](https://tpw.co.in)) 
3. Theolosophy - This contains all my notes regarding theology and philosophy.

I will continue to add more directories as I see fit.

# Workflow (Audio DSP)
Usually, I read some material regarding Audio DSP, go back and forth with Gemini. Then once I understand all the concepts, I think of a project idea based on what I just learnt and try to build something.

The comments you see in the code are usually written by me when I revisit what I wrote later on.

The .md files for each project are generated by Gemini itself by summarizing the conversation and breaking it down into first principle thinking. I don't really bother to check them. Even the Obsidian links are generated by Gemini itself after I give some of my own Obsidian notes to it.

The order in which I am attempting things has also been decided by Gemini. The point is to just start somewhere.

# Why first principle thinking?
